This is a REST API authentication solution created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This uses nodemon to reflect changes without restarting the server again and again during development.

To start the production server, type:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The api will run at port specified in environment variable or by default at port 5000. 

User registration and login routes are available. This is a token based solution to authentication.

To get started, clone the repository and add environment variables in .env file.
